# My personal nvim config

Sick to death of using lazy and nvchad, too much juju for a thing that
puts words on the computer. 

Uploading for myself, so I can keep everything *exactly the same*.

Not a fancy one with LSPs, or even auto complete. To install the plugins,
run ':PlugInstall' when you first start using the config.

"minimal" in a way that remains fast for me, if you want full 
**MINIMALISM**, try out ed.
